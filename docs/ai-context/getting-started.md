### Installation

::: callout tip Recommended Method: NPX
Using `npx` is the easiest way to run `aicontext` as it ensures you are always using the latest version without needing a global installation.
:::

```bash
npx aicontext [options]
```

If you prefer to have the command available system-wide, you can install it globally via npm:

```bash
npm install -g aicontext
```

### Your First Context File

```bash
npx aicontext -p nodejs
```

```bash
npx aicontext
```
