All core behaviors and feature toggles in Smart WebView are controlled from a single configuration file: `app/src/main/assets/swv.properties`. This allows you to customize your app without touching any Java or Gradle code.

---

## How to Configure

1.  Open your project in Android Studio.
2.  Navigate to the `app/src/main/assets/` directory.
3.  Open the `swv.properties` file and modify the values as needed.
4.  Rebuild your project (`Build > Rebuild Project`) for the changes to take effect.
